/**
 * This class implements the object that handles client connections. 
 * One such object exists per open connections at any given time.
 * <p>The basic architecture is the following: the httpd instance accepts 
 * new connections on its port. When such a connection is accepted a Client 
 * object is requested to the client pool (which can implement what ever 
 * strategy is suitable). Each request is than managed by looking up an
 *  resource and invoking the resource methods corresponding to the request.
